Ok, so right now the website idea is not working out well.
  -the username setup is not responding right. 
  -if the username is not responding then blocking people from changing stuff will not work
  -figure it out!!!
I do want to set up the program part of the task_manager as well. That might be a better way to do it
  -the program side will have two parts
    -1 a terminal user interface that will do everything the website will do
    -2 a GUI that will work in the Raspi GUI.
